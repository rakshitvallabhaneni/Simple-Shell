# Simple-Shell
Implementation of a simple UNIX shell without using system() and execvp(). Capable of handling multiple pipes.

The Makefile can be used to compile and execute using ./shell


Any UNIX commands including vim, FILE commands should work without any issues. The address of the binary can also be included in the command if you want to execute a particular binary.
